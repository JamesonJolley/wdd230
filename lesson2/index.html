        <p>Although this isn't the best example. YouTube makes use of contrast and images, and titles to help you find the video you whant. All videos have an image and title which is notorious for being 'click bate'. To me, that facked that it's called that proves the effectiveness of a good hierarchal structure.</p>

        <p>When i look at this page my eyes are drawn to that big button asking me to download the app. This is a good use of contrast because your eyes are immediately drawn to what they want you to do which is downloading the app. </p>

        <p>This is a good example of Hick's Law. You come to this site usually to "Get Minecraft". As soon as the page lodes it's right in front of you. It's easy to understand what to do to "Get Minecraft" because it's large and styled like a button.</p>
